              I'm a passionate full-stack developer and Computer Science &
              Engineering student with a deep focus on creating intuitive,
              high-performance web experiences. My journey began with curiosity
              about how things work behind the screen â€” and that curiosity soon
              turned into a commitment to building user-friendly, accessible,
              and responsive applications.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text">
              Over time, I've explored diverse domains including front-end
              development with React and Bootstrap, back-end logic with Node.js,
              and database integration using SQL and MongoDB. I thrive on
              transforming creative ideas into real-world digital solutions that
              make a difference. I believe that a clean interface and clean code
              go hand in hand, and I always aim for both.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text">
              My approach combines technical precision with a creative mindset.
              I continuously challenge myself by learning modern tools and
              frameworks, whether it's enhancing UI/UX, exploring cybersecurity,
              or experimenting with AI/ML concepts.
